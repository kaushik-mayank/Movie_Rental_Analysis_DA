## Project Workflow

### 1 Data Extraction & Cleaning (SQL)

* Queried multiple tables: Customers, Films, Rentals, Payments, Staff, Stores
* Merged related tables (customer ‚Üí address ‚Üí city ‚Üí country)
* Removed duplicates and handled missing values
* Created **fact and dimension tables** to support a star schema

### 2 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Answered 15+ business questions: customer loyalty, seasonal trends, film demand, staff impact
* Exported results to **Excel** for visualization and trend analysis
* Used charts instead of raw tables for better clarity

### 3 Dashboard Building in Power BI

#### Data Model

* Designed a **Star Schema**:
  * **Fact Tables:** Rentals, Payments  
  * **Dimension Tables:** Customers, Staff, Stores, Films, Dates  
* Merged lookup tables (address, city, country, category, language) into dimension tables
* Simplified relationships to improve **DAX performance**

#### Key Measures (DAX)

* `Total Revenue` ‚Üí SUM of payments  
* `Total Rentals` ‚Üí COUNT of rentals  
* `On-Time Return %` ‚Üí ratio of rentals returned before due date  
* `Revenue per Customer` ‚Üí AVG revenue per unique customer  
* `Rentals per Copy` ‚Üí inventory efficiency  

#### Dashboard Pages

1. **Executive Overview** ‚Äì KPIs, Revenue Trends  
2. **Customers & Segments** ‚Äì RFM Segmentation, Top Customers  
3. **Films & Inventory** ‚Äì Rentals by Category, Film √ó Store Matrix  
4. **Staff & Store Performance** ‚Äì Staff Efficiency, Revenue by Store  
5. **Recommendations** ‚Äì Summary of insights with action points  

#### Visual Design

* Consistent **color theme** (green = growth, red = issues, yellow = neutral)  
* Applied **slicers** for time, store, category  
* Storytelling layout: KPIs at top ‚Üí Trends ‚Üí Detailed tables

## Challenges in Power BI

* Many-to-many relationships (films ‚Üî categories, films ‚Üî actors)  
* Custom time intelligence using `dim_date` table  
* Ratio measures (rentals per copy, on-time %)  
* Avoiding cluttered visuals  
* Balancing **business readability with technical accuracy**

## EDA Key Insights

### Customer Behavior

* Repeat customers drive higher revenue  
* Younger customers prefer family/animation films  
* 30‚Äì40 age group prefers drama and action  

### Films & Inventory

* Action and Animation are most in-demand  
* English films dominate, regional preferences exist  
* Popular categories face stock shortages  

### Staff & Store Performance

* Stores near customers have 2.5√ó higher rental frequency  
* Evenings & weekends are peak rental times  

### Seasonal & Regional Trends

* Rentals peak in **summer holidays** and **December**  
* Romance films popular in Europe, Action in the US  
* Cultural events influence viewing behavior

## Conclusion & Learnings

* Applied **MECE framework** for structured analysis  
* Built **end-to-end workflow:** SQL ‚Üí Excel ‚Üí Power BI  
* Dashboard highlights trends in revenue, loyalty, inventory, and operations  
* Improved **SQL, DAX, Power BI, and storytelling skills**  

 Data was converted into a **clear business story** that decision-makers can act on.
